# Simplification Plan

## What Ved Actually Needs

1. **Lessons Page** - Read through Manning content
2. **Code Playground** - Practice exercises from each lesson
3. **Progress tracking** - Simple "completed lessons" counter

## What to Remove

1. ❌ "Start Next Challenge" button - Not relevant
2. ❌ "Review Flashcards" - Quiz system not working/needed
3. ❌ "Teach Back Validator" - Not used
4. ❌ Complex milestone system - Overkill
5. ❌ Streak tracking - Not needed
6. ❌ Challenges view entirely - Not relevant to Manning book learning

## New Simplified Dashboard

**Keep:**
- "Continue Learning" → Goes to lessons
- "Code Playground" → Practice coding
- "View Progress" → Simple list of completed lessons

**Remove:**
- Next Challenge button
- Review Flashcards button  
- Teach Back button
- Complex milestone cards
- Streak counter
- Skills counter

## Fixes Needed

1. Fix code-playground.js errors (addEventListener on null)
2. Add proper error logging to server
3. Add favicon to stop 404 errors
4. Simplify index.html dashboard
5. Make lessons the primary interface
